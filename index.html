<p>Imagine Twitter in 1983.
Well, computers back in 1983 didn't have 256 colors. ClutterFeed was born from the pressing need to eliminate this issue.</p>

<p>We understand that ClutterFeed's state-of-the-art™ design may initially seem confusing to someone who is used to the boring, uninspiring designs of yesterday. However, after using it for a little while the design proves to be very intuitive. To help users with this transition, we have designed an image to explain things a bit.

<p><strong>Amazing Name</strong> -- ClutterFeed, since version 1.6.0, uses inspiring release names. The names not only make it have more artistic value, but it makes ClutterFeed feel more <em>personal</em>. Which ClutterFeed release was <em>yours?</em></p>

<p><strong>Pro Taste</strong> -- ClutterFeed users have been proven to have better taste in various types of new-age media. Such papers were published by students at MIT and Nottingham University.</p>

<p><strong>Tweet Identifier™</strong> -- The most groundbreaking innovation that ClutterFeed brings to the table. No more will you need to memorize the user IDs of your closest friends or have to look up tweet IDs in your monthly Twitter catalog. With Tweet Identifiers™, those things are a thing of the past! Let ClutterFeed do all your work for you!</p>

<p><strong>Character Count</strong> -- A count of how long your tweet is. Developed with scientists responsible for the MatLab®, the mathematics behind this feature are never-before-seen in consumer applications!</p>

<p><strong>Command/Tweet</strong> -- The holy grail of command lines. This friendly shell not only understands when you are only tweeting and not trying to use a command, but also is the first consumer application to use the Command History technology. This technology lets the user re-use commands they used before without having to re-type them!</p>
