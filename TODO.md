#TODO
Not in any specific order 

#### Timed update (every 5 min)
 If I can figure it out. Sweating_canadian.png

#### Notepad++ has a button that's a japanese flag
 It might be the record macro button tho

#### Lists
 Though I'm not sure how I should do it

#### Tweets on /profile
 Not that difficult

#### A config file for colors

#### Multi user support

#### Reply to all functionality
 Because I think it only currently replies to the tweet author

#### Help dialog in stuff like /profile and /me

#### Direct message support

#### Friends list
 So you can see what your friends tweet on your timeline IN PRETTY COLORS OOOOO

## **Change the way updates work**
 Make list with full update, new updates added to list, only 15 newest displayed instead of the whole list

#### Move the \a for new notifications to the GetUpdates methods for getting updates instead of when displayed
 Also make it the MSN buzzer sound
